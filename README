You can change the command level using !cmdlevel <command> <level>. The plugin
also changes the configuration file of the appropriate plugin. Instead of
!cmdlevel you can also use !bmcmdlevel.

The command level can be shown using !showcmdlevel <command>.

This plugin is tested for Urban Terror 4.1 and the B3 bot versions 1.3 and
1.3.4b.
